# fast-website
Coded in HTML/CSS/JS and optimized web. 
For animation, I used Animate On Scroll Library. 
To preserve and normalize style across the browsers, instead of removing styles, I coded with normalized CSS. 
Moreover, google fonts for this web. This website is not only web optimized but mobile as well. 
I used:
  SVGSPRITE for fetching icons with a single HTTP request. 
  Cubic-bezier for a smooth animation. 
  Clip-path-maker to make shape like polygon.
